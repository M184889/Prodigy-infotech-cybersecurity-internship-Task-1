# Prodigy-infotech-cybersecurity-internship-Task-1
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  In this project, a Python program is implemented to:  Encrypt a userâ€™s message by shifting characters forward.

Description:
-------------
This project implements a Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption program in Python.
It allows users to enter a message and a shift value, then either encrypt or decrypt the message.

How to Run the Program:
------------------------
1. Make sure Python is installed. Run:
   python --version

2. Open Terminal / PowerShell.

3. Navigate to the script's folder:
   Example:
   cd "D:/Internships Files/Prodigy Infotec Internship 2/"

4. Run the program:
   python "ceasar cipher.py"

5. Enter:
   - 'E' to encrypt
   - 'D' to decrypt
   - The message and shift value

Example Output:
----------------
=== Caesar Cipher Program ===  
Type 'E' for Encrypt or 'D' for Decrypt: E  
Enter your message: Hello World  
Enter the shift value (e.g., 3): 3  
Encrypted Message: Khoor Zruog

Note:
------
- Only letters are shifted; punctuation and spaces remain unchanged.
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters.
